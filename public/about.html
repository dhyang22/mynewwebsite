<h1> Why this Journey </h1>
<hr />  
<div class="container">  
  <p>  
     What it takes to become a software professional - is it by being good at Coding? good at Communication ? 
     by being a great team player ? by being a self motivator ? by having capability to handle multiple tasks ? technical expertise ?
     Empathy and Creative Thinker ?    
     So you need more then coding skill to become a great software professional. One more thing you need is - Mentoring ? to take
     your career in the correct direction. Note, unless you work on the area you like, you will not get 
     satisfaction in your career. 

     Also Note unless we do research and innovate, country may not progress. This should be developed at early stage of your 
     professional life.
     
     We are undertaking this journey to help younger generation to imbibe these qualities in their
     early college education.
